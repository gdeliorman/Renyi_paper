# A Rényi-Divergence-Based Family of Metrics for the Evaluation of Surrogate Endpoints in a Causal Inference Framework

## Project Description
In this project, we extend the Individual Causal Association (ICA) proposed by Alonso et al. (2015) by a new family of surrogacy metrics derived from Rényi divergence. We evaluate the performance of this extended family through simulation studies and application using clinical trial data from schizophrenia data.
